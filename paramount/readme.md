## Paramount Overlay

### Covers black bars on the sides of videos

#### 4:3 Overlays work on full screen and the normal browser window
#### 16:9 Overlays disappear in full screen but show up in the normal browser window

##### Find alternate frames inside the folders labeled "16-9" and "4-3"

##### All overlays default to the oak selections, just replace the url in the respective css to the ones you want. I set up multiple styles so I can toggle, you can also just use the ones I made as templates to make your own. 

### Recent Updates

##### Added alternate versions to turn the video and frames black and white. Check comments in the CSS for more details.
