## Modified Sword and Shield Layout for Pokemon Showdown


###### This is a slightly modified version of the Sword and Shield layout by harasuke from the following link, also linked at the bottom of this page.
###### https://github.com/harasuke/SwSh-Showdown-Layout

###### Link to spinning pokeball logo provided at bottom of page.

###### Background created by layering multiple sources that I combined a while back. I don't have the sources due to the time gap, but they are not created by me, only stacked for a desktop background.
 
#### Usage
##### Intended to be used with the Stylus browser extension to be implemented on Pokemon Showdown. 
###### Write a new style within Stylus, copy and paste the css file, apply to only Pokemon Showdown.
###### I usually disable the style by default and just activate it when I get to Showdown.

#### Alternative Usage (easier)
###### Download the original file to directly use in Stylus from https://userstyles.world/style/16603/pokemon-swsh-layout then just edit the file by replacing the existing css with the css from this page. 

#### Changes made:
* colors modified to a red and black theme
* rounded edges in various places
* stats box appearance 
* increased battleground size
* moved chat and made smaller
* moved some things around to fit new sizing
* swapped out logo because I found a cool one
* various other small changes not documented

##### Notes
###### I am not sure how dynamic the styling is. I set it up to work on both my monitors, so it should work. If it doesn't, just scroll through the file and find the sizes. You can modify everything with context clues or AI if need be.
