## Modified Sword and Shield Battle Layout for Pokemon Showdown


###### This is a slightly modified version of the Sword and Shield layout by harasuke from the following link, also linked at the bottom of this page.
###### https://github.com/harasuke/SwSh-Showdown-Layout

###### I only modified styles in the actual battles, any other changes, such as team builder, are from the original author.

#### Details:
* colors modified to a red and black theme
* rounded edges in various places
* stats box appearance 
* increased battleground size
* moved chat and made smaller
* moved some things around to fit new sizing
* swapped out logo to a spinning pokeball
* various other small changes not documented
 
#### Use
###### Write new style in Stylus, under "Code 1" select "URLs on domain", then add "play.pokemonshowdown.com", "psim.us", and "replay.pokemonshowdown.com". Copy and paste text from css document then save. Enable or disable based on preference.

#### Alternate Installation 
###### Download the original file directly to Stylus from https://userstyles.world/style/16603/pokemon-swsh-layout then just edit the file by replacing the existing css with the css from this page.

##### Notes
###### I am not sure how dynamic the styling is. I set it up to work on both my monitors, so it should work. If it doesn't, just scroll through the file and find the sizes. You can modify everything with context clues or AI if need be.
